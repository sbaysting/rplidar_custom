Hampel - Outlier filter
	- Takes 3 points from each side
	-  It also estimates the standard deviation of each sample about its window median using the median absolute deviation. If a sample differs from the median by more than three standard deviations, it is replaced with the median
	- TLDR: Needs 7 points to operate, but tested with 1 on each side and works fine

Moving Average - Curve smoother
	- Gets reasonably smooth after using 20 points to average

Points in 10 seconds - 4094
409.4 points per second

What will work: Hampel
If you want curvy data: Hampel + Moving Average @ 20 points
